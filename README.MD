# Backend Documentation

This document outlines the architecture and key components of the backend.

**1. Configuration**

* All configuration parameters, including database credentials, IoT device pin numbers, and other settings, are stored in a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory.
* This approach promotes better organization, improves maintainability, and allows for easier environment-specific configurations.

**2. Servo Control**

* **Library:** The backend utilizes the `github.com/cgxeiji/servo` library for controlling servos.
* **`pi-blaster`:** This library leverages the `pi-blaster` systemd service for efficient and low-latency communication with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
* **Benefits:**
    * **Smooth and Fast Control:** `pi-blaster` ensures smooth and responsive servo movements.
    * **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Optimized for efficient communication with the GPIO pins.

**3. Ultrasonic Sensor Control**

* **Library:** The backend utilizes the `github.com/stianeikeland/go-rpio/v4` library for direct GPIO control.
* **Direct GPIO Access:** Provides low-level control over the GPIO pins, enabling precise timing for accurate distance measurements.

**4. Backend Framework**

* **`net/http`:** The backend is built upon the standard `net/http` package for handling HTTP requests.
* **`gorilla/websocket`:** The `gorilla/websocket` library is integrated for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication with the frontend via WebSockets.

**5. WebSockets**

* **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets provide a robust mechanism for real-time data exchange between the frontend and backend.
* **Bidirectional Data Flow:** Enables both the frontend and backend to send and receive messages asynchronously.
* **Applications:**
    * **Real-time control:** Control servos, sensors, and other devices in real-time from the frontend.
    * **Live data streaming:** Stream sensor data or other information from the backend to the frontend.
    * **User interactions:** Handle user interactions and events seamlessly.

**6. Future Considerations**

* **Scalability:** Explore options for scaling the backend horizontally or vertically to accommodate increasing traffic and data volumes.
* **Security:** Implement robust security measures, such as authentication, authorization, and data encryption, to protect sensitive data.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrate monitoring and logging tools to track system performance, identify potential issues, and gain insights into system behavior.

**This document provides a high-level overview of the test backend architecture. For more detailed information, please refer to the source code and individual components.**

**Note:** This is a basic outline. You can expand on this with more specific details about your project, such as:

* **Database schema**
* **API endpoints**
* **Error handling and logging mechanisms**
* **Testing and deployment strategies**

By maintaining clear and concise documentation, you can improve the maintainability, understandability, and overall quality of your project.
